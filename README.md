# ITk Timebased reporting

This is a quick tool to query the ITkdb and make live population timeline reports. Included is some basic code that should ge the job doen just make sure you get the paths rigight and download the right dependencies. I would recommend ```python3.9``` or above as some of the suff dosent work other wise. Try the tutorial first to see how the pipline works. Have a look at ```component migration plotting.pdf``` for a look at live reports and pics of example plots.

God's speed ITk-er.
